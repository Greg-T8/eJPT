# My eJPT Journey
I am using this repository to document my learnings as I undertake preparation for the [eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester (eJPT)](https://elearnsecurity.com/product/ejpt-certification/) certification. Training for the eJPT is provided by [INE](https://ine.com), of which eLearnSecurity is a subsidiary. INE stands for InternetNetwork Expert.

The eJPT certification is the first of a series of certifications I intend to achieve to expand my knowledge in pentesting and offensive security operations:
1. eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Testing (eJPT)
2. eLearnSecurity Certified Professional Penetration Tester (eCPPT)
3. Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP)

I discovered this certification track from the good folks at Reddit in this thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pentesting/comments/dq7rxn/oscp_vs_gpen_and_gxpen/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf). Here is an awesome link to a chart outlining all the numerous security certifications and where the eJPT comes into play: https://pauljerimy.com/security-certification-roadmap/.

You can see where these certifications lie in the grand scheme of certifications in the **Security Operations** domain:
